We are using:
    mqtt listener   = scripts/mqtt/mqtt-socket-client.py
    pid starter     = scripts/lights/lightsocketsvr.py
    routine scripts = scripts/lights/*


The listener is waiting for mqtt messages
    when recieved it will call the pid starter 
        The pid starter will determin if it needs to start a routine - like fade - or just toggle something


Everything is based around an mqtt message
